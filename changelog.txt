Version: 1.0.0 (Initial release)
Date: 17th January 2025

Major features:
    - A fully-fledged dynamic crop generation system, powered by tterrag1098/Registrate
        - Includes a bunch of crops that I think will serve best for my pack at the moment.
    - Anti-Trample boots
        - Any LivingEntities wearing the boots cannot trample ANY farmland (it cancels the FarmlandTrampleEvent)
